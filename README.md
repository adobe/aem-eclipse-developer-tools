#### Using Unreleased Versions

If you need fixes that have not yet been released, you can use the development build. A p2-update-site zip file is automatically generated after each merge to master:

2. Click on the latest successful workflow run from the master branch
3. Download the `p2-update-site` artifact from the Artifacts section

The artifact contains the Eclipse update site that can be used for plugin installation. The artifacts have a limited retention period and will not be available indefinitely.
